# TO DO

- Fix import base url

* all listings are displayed on the feed.html
* If you click on a product it takes you to products.html
* Only registrated users, or token != "", may bid (maybe only registrated can open the product page).
* in profile.html should the edit and delete post be on a seperate page?

1. Get all listings and place them on feed.html
2. Link each product to the product.html page.
3. Add querystring placing the correct ID.
4. Populate product.html with content from the single listing.
