# The Auction House | Semester-Project-2

## Description

Semester project for the third semester. The assigment was to create an auction site. I buildt the frontend based on an API that was provided.  

The site was to be created with the following user stories:

A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register
A registered user may login
A registered user may logout
A registered user may update their avatar
A registered user may view their total credit
A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description
A registered user may add a Bid to another user’s Listing
A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing
A registered user may use credit to make a Bid on another user’s Listing
An unregistered user may search through Listings

## Known issues
* During component testing, the system did not allow the use of the '.mjs' extension. As a result, some of the components had to be converted to use the '.js' extension instead.

## Future improvments
* Implement additional functionality. The API allows for the implementation of more functionality, such as the ability to delete one's own listing. 
* Improve styling, particularly on product items."
